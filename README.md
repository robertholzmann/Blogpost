# My Big Fat Data Science Project

## Installation

Ready to dive in? No special requirements here! If you’ve got the Anaconda distribution of Python, you’re all set. My project primarily uses `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`—so make sure those are good to go.

The code is built for Python 3, so as long as you're running that, it should be smooth sailing.

## Project Motivation

Welcome to my first solo data science adventure, now proudly on display for the world to see!

This project started as Project 1 of my Data Science Nanodegree at Udacity (cue the applause). But like any good data scientist, I couldn’t help but venture off the beaten path. I dug around the web for some intriguing datasets to sink my teeth into.

I’m aiming for a career in International Relations, so I wanted to pick a topic that’s not just fascinating but also meaningful for my portfolio. 

That’s when I stumbled upon a dataset of Defense Contracting Companies on Kaggle and the Arms Industry Database from SIPRI (Stockholm International Peace Research Institute).

With these datasets, I set out to explore:

1. What are the top US 5 defense contractors and how have they grown over time?
2. Which countries are home to the largest defense contractors?
3. Which countries' defense companies have grown the most in recent years? Which have grown the most over the last 20 years?
4. How have world events impacted the market caps of defense contractors?

Military and defense spending is a vast, complex topic. But by honing in on defense companies, I believe we can uncover some telling insights about military spending as a whole.

There’s so much more I’d love to explore, but for now, this project has me feeling pretty proud. And hey, I’m just getting started—there’s plenty more research in my future!

## File Descriptions

Inside the repository, you’ll find three Jupyter notebooks under the `Real Deal` folder, each dedicated to a specific dataset. These notebooks contain all the data wrangling, analysis, and visualizations used to answer the questions I posed above. You’ll also find a folder named `Datasets` housing the raw data files.

## Results

Curious about what I discovered? I’ve compiled my findings into a blog post, which you can check out [here](#).
